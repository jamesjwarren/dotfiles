# James' dotfiles

These are config files to setup a system how I like it. It uses [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and has additional bootstrap for macOS with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

## Installation

The repo can be cloned whereever, I like to keep it in `~/.dotfiles`.
```
git clone https://github.com/jamesjwarren/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
source bootstrap.sh
```

To update, cd into your local dotfiles repository and then:
```
source bootstrap.sh
```

### Extras

- Font: [Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack#quick-installation)
- Icons: [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
